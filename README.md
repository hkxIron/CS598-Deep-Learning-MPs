**Problem 1: Implementation of fully connected neural network from scratch using numpy**

Implement and train a neural network from scratch in Python for the MNIST dataset (no PyTorch). The neural network should be trained on the Training Set using stochastic gradient descent. Target accuracy on the test set: 97-98%

**Problem 2: Implementation of Convolution Neural Network from scratch using numpy**

Implement and train a convolution neural network from scratch in Python for the MNIST dataset (no PyTorch). The convolution network should have a single hidden layer with multiple channels. Target accuracy on the test set: 94% accuracy on the Test Set

**Problem 3: Implementation of Deep CNN for CIFAR 10**

Train a deep convolution network on a GPU with PyTorch for the CIFAR10 dataset. The convolution network should use dropout, trained with RMSprop or ADAM, and data augmentation. Also, compare dropout test accuracy using the heuristic prediction rule and Monte Carlo simulation.
